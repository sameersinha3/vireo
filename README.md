# vireo

Vireo is an app to educate the world on our food choices. Unlike an app like MyFitnessPal, which focuses on overall caloric intake, micro- and macro- nutrient consumption, and hitting our overall nutrition goals, Vireo aims to alert users of the acutal ingredients and whether or not they are harmful. For example, while many Americans consider aspartame to be unsafe, current research suggests it's safe in moderation. On the other hand, very few Americans actively avoid things like "sodium benzoate," simply because we've never heard of it.

Vireo aims to make this information accessible to all, by allowing you to scan the barcode, and you will get a breakdown of the ingredients; which ones are good, which ones are bad, and whether or not you need to "fear" a certain ingredient. Upon scanning, we hope to link actual studies and evidence to justify whether certain ingredients are safe, risky, or need more research!
